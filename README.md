# Coding-samples. 

This repository contains three examples of code that I have written. 

The first, pdf-parsing, is a script I wrote in Python while working as a research assistant for Professor Adam Zelizer at Harris School of Public Policy. The code takes Assembly and Senate Journals from the Nevada legislature and creates a data set with the legislators' information, including name, party, and district, as well as how they voted on every bill from that session. 

The second script, data-cleaning, is a short script in R that I wrote to clean a data set for a project I am working on with the economic research club at the University of Chicago. The code cleans up a data set that has temperatures in a number of different states over those courses of the past twenty years. Note that the data used in the script is fabricated and merely for teaching purposes. 

The third script, data-viz, is a script in R that I wrote for the final project of a class that took on bioinformatics and gene analysis. The code creates a number plots to visualize genomic data of a specific individual. The code uses data I created in the class that determines and annotates all mutations in this individual's genome.
